# leviathan
GitHub actions server for Leviathan team. Used for more extensive testing, building, and other time-sensitive processes.

Notes:
    - All of the files in executables were originally stored on the SVN, but were moved here for the sake of visibility. While the names are the same, the paths used in the workflows won't line up with them.
        - They were compiled with [pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/)
        - For details on usage, use "(executable) --help"
    - For obvious reasons the repo_dispatch.token doesn't actually contain a token. You'll need to generate one yourself.
